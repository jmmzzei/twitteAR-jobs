# twitteAR-jobs

Server-side rendered web app that allows searching for IT job offers posted on Twitter. Made with Node.js, Express, EJS, Sass and some Vanilla JS in the front. It's made for spanish speakers so the results are going to be showed in that language.

Although it was said that the application is only for searching IT related job offers, the app can perform any search the user wants based on keywords, hashtags and unwanted words. Nevertheless, it's recommended to use this app only for its main purpose because it was created to isolate the user of Twitter's environment during job hunt.
